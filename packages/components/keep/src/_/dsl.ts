 * A retrieval a shape admits.

 * States what a call site may ask of a shape, as the dual of {@link @metreeca/blue/value!Instance | Instance}, which
 * states what the shape yields: a caller writes a `Model` and reads back a {@link Delivery}, and the shape decides
 * what either may contain.
 * A model takes either form the surface accepts, a traversal composed against the shape's {@link Cursor}, or a
 * document {@link compile | compiled} against the shape.
 *
 * A traversal is held to the shape where it is written, since the cursor offers no member the shape does not carry.
 * A compiled document is held to it where it is decoded, so a document naming an undeclared member is refused at run
 * time rather than at the call site.
 *
 * @typeParam S The shape the retrieval is stated against, possibly deferred to break definition cycles
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Stated as the two forms a model is written in rather than as the retrievals the shape admits. Defining it
 * structurally, as a template narrowed to the members the shape carries, would hold a compiled document to the shape
 * at the call site as well and would let {@link Delivery} read a single well-formed model rather than tell the two
 * forms apart.
